President Parser

This project analyzes presidential speeches taken from University of Virginia’s Miller Center. Speeches for a specific president are retrieved from millercenter.org using JSoup	and are then parsed into a directed graph, where words are vertices and an edge from vertex A to vertex B indicates that A is ‘followed’ by B somewhere in one of the speeches. Edge weights are assigned based on the frequency of these ‘followings’. With this directed graph created, various implemented tools allow users to extract data about the speeches analyzed. A phrase generator enables the user to select a president and generate a random phrase from a given length based on randomly returning a new ‘following’ vertex from a randomly chosen one and recursing for a given president’s speech collection. A phrase matcher enables the user to examine multiple presidents’ speech collections, enter a sentence, and return a president most likely to have said the given sentence, based on shortest path length.Information networks were used.
