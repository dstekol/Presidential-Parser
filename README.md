# Presidential-Parser

This was an open-ended final project for NETS 150 @ the University of Pennsylvania (Freshman Year, Spring 2018). 
The project, which was done in collaboration with John Flahive, parses presidential speeches from the web and constructs a word-use graph, which it uses to probabilistically generate random sentences in the style of a given president.
The project's ideas and implementation are original work, but the code also makes use of graph algorithms such as BFS implemented by the authors from scratch earlier in the semester. More thorough explanations of the project details can be found in the summary.txt and "Presidential Parser Manual.pdf" files.
