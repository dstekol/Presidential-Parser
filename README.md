# Presidential-Parser

This was an open-ended final project for NETS 150 @ the University of Pennsylvania (Freshman Year, Spring 2018). 
The project, which was done in collaboration with John Flahive, parses presidential speeches from the web and constructs a word-use graph, which it uses to probabilistically generate random sentences in the style of a given president.
The project's ideas and implementation are original work. More detailed explanations can be found in the summary.txt and "Presidential Parser Manual.pdf" files.
